**Zewo** is a set of libraries for server side development. With **Zewo** you can write your web app, REST API, command line tool, database driver, etc. Our goal is to create an ecosystem around the modules and tools we provide so you can focus on developing your application or library, instead of doing everything from scratch.

Currently, we have around 50+ packages. This list grows very fast so it might be outdated. To be sure just check our [organization](https://github.com/Zewo).

# Documentation

Below we provide a getting started guide. This guide can also be found in our official [documentation](docs.zewo.io). The documentation contains more info than this guide and we're adding even more every day.

# Getting started

## Installation

Before we start we need to install the appropriate **Swift** binaries and **Zewo** dependencies.

### OS X

#### Install Xcode

Download and install **Xcode 7.3** or greater.

- [Xcode Download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)

#### Install Swift

**Zewo 0.3** requires February 8, 2016 **Swift Development Snapshot**.

- [Swift Development Snapshot](https://swift.org/builds/development/xcode/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a-osx.pkg)
- [Debugging Symbols (Optional)](https://swift.org/builds/development/xcode/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a-osx-symbols.pkg)

After installing add the swift toolchain to your path, so you can build swift from the command line.

```sh
export PATH=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a.xctoolchain//usr/bin:"${PATH}"
```

On **Xcode** you can choose the appropriate toolchain from `Preferences > Componentes > Toolchains`.

#### Install Zewo

After installing Swift we need to install Zewo's dependencies.

```sh
brew install zewo/tap/zewo
```


This will install our current dependencies:

- [libvenice](https://github.com/Zewo/libvenice)
- [http_parser](https://github.com/Zewo/http_parser)
- [uri_parser](https://github.com/Zewo/uri_parser)
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/)


### Linux

On **Linux** we provide a shell script that automates the whole installation process.

#### Ubuntu 15.10

```sh
wget https://raw.github.com/Zewo/Zewo/master/Scripts/install-zewo0.2.3-ubuntu15.10.sh -O - | sh
```

#### Ubuntu 14.04

```sh
wget https://raw.github.com/Zewo/Zewo/master/Scripts/install-zewo0.2.3-ubuntu14.04.sh -O - | sh
```

You can also install everything manually.

### Install Swift

Install swift dependencies.

```sh
sudo apt-get install clang libicu-dev
```

Download the Swift Development Snapshot

#### Ubuntu 15.10

- [Swift Development Snapshot](https://swift.org/builds/development/ubuntu1510/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a-ubuntu15.10.tar.gz)

#### Ubuntu 14.04

 - [Swift Development Snapshot](https://swift.org/builds/development/ubuntu1404/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a/swift-DEVELOPMENT-SNAPSHOT-2016-02-08-a-ubuntu14.04.tar.gz)

Extract the archive. This creates a `usr` directory in the location of the archive.

```sh
tar xzf swift-<VERSION>-<PLATFORM>.tar.gz
```

Add the Swift toolchain to your path.

```sh
export PATH=/path/to/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
```

#### Install Zewo

```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] http://apt.zewo.io/deb ./" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zewo
```

This will install our current dependencies:

- [libvenice](https://github.com/Zewo/libvenice)
- [http_parser](https://github.com/Zewo/http_parser)
- [uri_parser](https://github.com/Zewo/uri_parser)
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/)

## Hello World Web App

To showcase what **Zewo** can do we'll create a hello world web app.

### Configure your project

First we need to create a directory for our app.

```sh
mkdir hello && cd hello
```

Then we initialize the project with Swift Package Manager (SPM).

```sh
swift build --init
```

This command will create the basic structure for our app.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ Sources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.swift
â””â”€â”€ Tests
```

Open `Package.swift` with your favorite editor and add `HTTPServer`, `Router` and `LogMiddleware` as dependencies.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "hello",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/Zewo/HTTPServer.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 3),
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/Zewo/Router.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 3),
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/Zewo/LogMiddleware.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 3)
    ]
)
```

### Do your magic

Open `main.swift` and make it look like this:

```swift
import HTTPServer
import Router
import LogMiddleware

let log = Log()
let logger = LogMiddleware(log: log)

let router = Router { route in
    route.get("/hello") { _ in
        return Response(body: "hello world")
    }
}

try Server(middleware: logger, responder: router).start()
```

This code:

- Creates an HTTP server that listens on port `8080` by default.
- Configures a router which will route `/hello` to a responder that responds with `"hello world"`.
- Mounts a logger middleware on the server that will log every request/response pair to the standard error stream (stderr) by default.

### Build and run

Now let's build the app.

```sh
swift build
```

After it compiles, run it.

```sh
.build/debug/hello
```

Now open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:8080/hello`. You should see `hello world` in your browser's window. ðŸ˜Š

## Developing with Xcode

Using Xcode for development can dramatically improve your productivity. For this reason we developed a tool called [zewo-dev](https://github.com/Zewo/zewo-dev) to helps us.

### Create App's Xcode project

First, let's configure an Xcode project for you app. Create a directory for Xcode in your app's root directory.

```sh
mkdir Xcode && cd Xcode
```

Install [Alcatraz](https://github.com/supermarin/Alcatraz) if you haven't already.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz/master/Scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Look for **Swift Command Line Application** under Templates in Alcatraz and install it.

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zewo/Docs/master/Images/SwiftCommandLineApplicationAlcatraz.png)

Restart Xcode and go to `File > New > Projects` and choose **Swift Command Line Application**. Save the project on the `Xcode` directory you just created.

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zewo/Docs/master/Images/SwiftCommandLineApplicationProject.png)

Remove the `main.swift` file that was generated and add the `Sources` directory from your app's root directory.

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zewo/Docs/master/Images/HelloMainXcode.png)

### Install zewo-dev

This tool will clone all repos from Zewo and generate Xcode projects for them.

```sh
gem install zewo-dev
```


Inside the Xcode directory create a directory for Zewo's Xcode projects.

```sh
mkdir Zewo && cd Zewo
```

Pull the repos and generate Xcode projects.

```sh
zewodev init && zewodev make_projects
```

### Add Zewo subprojects

With your app's Xcode project opened, drag and drop the required Xcode projects from Zewo to your project. In our example we should bring `HTTPServer.xcodeproj`, `Router.xcodeproj` and `LogMiddleware.xcodeproj`.

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zewo/Docs/master/Images/AddXcodeSubprojects.gif)

Go to your app's target `Build Phases > Target Dependencies` and add `HTTPServer`, `Router` and `LogMiddleware` frameworks.

![New Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zewo/Docs/master/Images/AddBuildPhaseDependencies.gif)

Now build and run as usual. After this you can open your favorite browser and go to `localhost:8080/hello`. You should see `hello world` again, but now running from Xcode. ðŸ˜Ž

## What's next?

Zewo has a **lot** of modules, check out our [organization](https://github.com/Zewo) for more. You can also take a look at our [documentation](http://docs.zewo.io/index.html) which is growing every day. If you have any doubts you can reach us at our [slack](http://slack.zewo.io). We're very active and always ready to help.

To make your life easier we provide the **Zewo** umbrella package which resides in this repository. This package provides the most important packages so you don't have to add all of them one by one.

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/Zewo/Zewo.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 3)
    ]
)
```
